# HyFixes v1.11.0 - Forgotten Temple & Interaction Fixes

**Release Date:** 2026-01-21

## 🎮 New Fixes

### SetMemoriesCapacity Fix (Issue #52)
- **Problem:** Players getting kicked with "ComponentType is invalid!" when interacting with the memorial/altar statue in Forgotten Temple instances
- **Cause:** `SetMemoriesCapacityInteraction.firstRun()` uses `PlayerMemories.getComponentType()` without checking if it's valid. In Forgotten Temple, the memories module isn't loaded.
- **Fix:** Added bytecode transformer that validates ComponentType before use. If invalid, the interaction fails gracefully instead of crashing.

### InteractionManager Client/Server Desync Fix
- **Problem:** Massive log spam with "Client finished chain earlier than server!" and full InteractionContext dumps
- **Cause:** Our Issue #40 timeout fix was removing chains from the server map without notifying the client
- **Fix:** Now using `cancelChains(chain)` instead of `map.remove()` to properly notify the client when a chain is cancelled

### SLF4J Classloader Conflict Fix
- **Problem:** Plugin failed to load with `LinkageError` on `SLF4J` classes
- **Cause:** SQLite JDBC driver bundles SLF4J which conflicts with Hytale's classloader
- **Fix:** Excluded SLF4J from the shadow JAR

### Log Spam Suppression
- **Problem:** "Client finished chain earlier than server" logs flooding console at SEVERE level
- **Fix:** Downgraded these logs from SEVERE to FINE (debug) level. Should no longer be triggered with the desync fix above.
